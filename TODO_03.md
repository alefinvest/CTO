# Smart Contract Interface Prompt

```Prompt-begin
// PROMPT: Implement a TypeScript interface for the smart contract at this location.
// The interface should accurately represent all public methods, events, and properties
// exposed by the contract. Use ethers.js or web3.js types as appropriate.
// Ensure the interface is well-documented, type-safe, and ready for integration
// with contract interaction code. Include comments for each method describing its purpose and parameters.

```

## Context
======= Context / Begin ======
This IBAN2IBAN proposal needs to be adjusted before we proceed with S___h and I___c.
1. CIS of sender and POF are required first
2. Risk assessment for HSBC IBAN2IBAN

# Summary of Proposal:
The proposal details a business transaction involving direct bank transfers to an HSBC Germany account. Key points include:
1. Test Transaction: Initial transactions range from €5-20K as a test. 
2. Transaction Confirmation: The receiver must provide a screenshot as proof of fund reception.
3. Escalating Transfers: After a successful test, amounts may increase up to €49M or more per tranche, depending on the receiver’s capability.
4. Slip Provision: Slips are provided to verify transactions. Initially, slips for the first tranche are open (unsanitized), but subsequent transactions require the receiver to send 25% of the funds back before receiving unsanitized slips.
5. Payment in USDT: The sender requests the 25% payout in USDT currency.
6. Final Arrangement: A 50/50 profit sharing is noted.

# Risk Assessment:
•  Payment Risk: The requirement for the receiver to return 25% before gaining full verification (unsanitized slips) exposes a risk of non-delivery of these slips, especially without collateral.
•  Receiver Legitimacy: Ensures the receiver is genuine by requiring them to join a meeting with verification documents.
•  Legality: Transactions should comply with international banking laws and anti-money laundering regulations.
•  Currency Fluctuations: Payment in USDT could lead to potential value changes due to cryptocurrency market volatility.

# Conclusion:
The arrangement poses a significant risk without proper legal guarantees. It would be wise for the receiver to seek legal advice before proceeding with any payments and to ensure protective clauses are in place. Ensuring all parties are legitimate and the system complies with relevant laws is crucial to mitigate potential risks.

Okay, I'm trying to adjust Sarah's IBAN2IBAN proposal based on the risk assessment provided. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, the risk assessment mentions that the CIS (Creditworthiness Information Summary) of the sender and POF (Proof of Funds) are required first. That makes sense because we need to ensure both parties are legitimate and capable of handling the transactions.

Next, I see the main risks identified: payment risk, receiver legitimacy, legality, and currency fluctuations. So, my goal is to address each of these in the proposal adjustments.

Starting with transaction confirmation, the current process relies on screenshots, but that might not be sufficient for legal purposes. Maybe we should include more formal documentation like signed agreements or official bank statements as proof. That would provide a stronger basis for verification.

For escalating transfers, the initial test is good, but to mitigate risk, we need a tiered approach with proper collateral or guarantees in place before increasing amounts. This way, both parties are protected if something goes wrong.

Regarding the slip provision, requiring 25% return seems risky without collateral. Perhaps integrating smart contracts could help automate the process and reduce reliance on manual verification. This would ensure that funds are held until slips are verified, adding an extra layer of security.

The payment in USDT introduces volatility risk due to cryptocurrency fluctuations. To mitigate this, maybe suggest hedging strategies or using a more stable currency for initial transactions. Also, legal advice is crucial here to comply with regulations and prevent any legal issues down the line.

In terms of profit sharing, 50/50 might be fair, but it's better to outline clear conditions under which this split applies, ensuring both parties meet their obligations before profits are distributed.

I should also include a section on compliance and legal review. It's essential that all parties engage legal counsel to draft contracts that cover each risk point mentioned. This includes clauses about collateral, verification processes, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

Lastly, implementing monitoring and reporting tools would help track transactions in real-time, allowing early detection of any discrepancies or suspicious activities. Regular audits can further ensure compliance and mitigate risks over time.

Based on the risk assessment provided, here's an adjusted version of the IBAN2IBAN proposal to address the identified issues:

---

**Adjusted Proposal for IBAN2IBAN Transaction**

1. **CIS and POF Requirements:**
   - Ensure that both the sender and receiver provide their Creditworthiness Information Summary (CIS) and Proof of Funds (POF) documents before initiating any transactions.
   - These documents will be verified by legal counsel to confirm legitimacy and creditworthiness.

2. **Transaction Confirmation Process:**
   - In addition to requiring a screenshot, formal written confirmation from the receiver's bank must be provided as proof of fund reception.
   - Both parties should maintain records of all transactions for at least 5 years in compliance with regulatory requirements.

3. **Escalating Transfers:**
   - Initial test transactions will remain between €5-20K to assess feasibility and operational efficiency.
   - Before increasing transaction amounts, both parties must agree on terms including collateral or guarantees to mitigate payment risks.
   - Escalation will only occur after a thorough review by legal and financial teams.

4. **Slip Provision Adjustment:**
   - Initial slips remain open (unsanitized), but subsequent transactions require the receiver to send 25% of the funds back before receiving unsanitized slips.
   - To mitigate risk, integrate a smart contract system that holds 25% of each tranche until verification is confirmed.

5. **Payment in USDT:**
   - The sender will request the 25% payout in USDT for initial transactions to ensure liquidity and reduce settlement times.
   - All parties must engage legal counsel to assess compliance with international banking laws, anti-money laundering regulations, and cryptocurrency regulations.

6. **Profit Sharing Arrangement:**
   - Maintain a 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement as outlined in the original proposal.
   - Clearly define conditions for profit sharing in written agreements reviewed by legal counsel.

7. **Compliance and Legal Review:**
   - All parties must seek independent legal advice to review contracts, transactions, and compliance with relevant laws.
   - Include clauses addressing payment risks, receiver legitimacy, currency fluctuations, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

8. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Implement monitoring tools to track transactions in real-time for compliance and risk management purposes.
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure adherence to agreed-upon terms and mitigation of identified risks.

---

**Conclusion:**

This adjusted proposal aims to address the risks highlighted in the risk assessment by incorporating additional safeguards, legal reviews, and structured processes. It is crucial that all parties engage legal counsel to ensure compliance with regulations and mitigate potential risks associated with high-value transactions involving cryptocurrency.

This version integrates the necessary precautions while maintaining the core elements of the original proposal, ensuring safer and more legally sound operations.
