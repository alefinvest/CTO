# CTO Code of Conduct for Bootcamps/Hackathons

## Our Vision

As a team participating in Bootcamps and Hackathons, we strive to create an environment that fosters innovation, collaboration, and mutual respect. We aim to build a community that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering for all members, regardless of their background, experience, or opinions.

We believe that every individual brings unique perspectives and strengths to the table, and we want to ensure that everyone feels valued, heard, and encouraged to contribute.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate any behavior that undermines our vision of a collaborative and respectful environment. This includes:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment of any kind
- Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other personal characteristic
- Unwelcome or inappropriate comments, jokes, or advances
- Intimidation, bullying, or coercion of any kind
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Our team leaders and administrators are committed to enforcing our code of conduct. They will take appropriate action in response to any behavior that violates our standards, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans, and reporting incidents to the necessary authorities.

If you experience or witness any unacceptable behavior, please report it to our administrators at <https://t.me/alefinvestxyz> or use the `/report` command in the [Bootcamps/hakaton](https://t.me/+zHtruvRvuqk4NDAy) chat.

All reports will be investigated promptly and fairly, and we will respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Guidelines for Enforcement

Our administrators will follow these guidelines when taking action:

- Use human judgment to address each situation appropriately.
- Provide warnings or temporary bans for first-time offenders, with the goal of educating them on our standards.
- Be transparent about the actions taken and the reasons behind them.
- Remove harmful content that could negatively impact others.
- Preserve the context of the situation by only removing the minimum necessary content.
